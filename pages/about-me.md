  bio: |
    I’m currently a junior studying Information Science and Systems at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland. I expect to graduate in 2026. My research explores the connection between technology and the human mind how brain computer interfaces and embedded systems can be used to improve interaction, assistive robotics, and real time neural signal processing. When I’m not doing research, I enjoy working on side projects, learning new tech skills, and spending time with friends.
