  bio: >
    I’m currently a senior studying Information Science and Systems at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland. I expect to graduate in 2026. My research explores the connection between technology and the human mind—how brain-computer interfaces and embedded systems can be used to improve interaction, assistive robotics, and real-time neural signal processing. When I’m not doing research, I enjoy working on side projects, learning new tech skills, and spending time with friends.
