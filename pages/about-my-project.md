subtitle: AI in Bioinformatics 
project_title: "Predicting Genetic Biomarkers of Brain Tumors Using Transcriptomic Data"

problem: |
  Brain tumor diagnosis and treatment heavily rely on genetic indicators. However, because of the intricacy and unpredictability of the data, utilizing AI to predict these markers from transcriptomic data is still difficult.

  In order to improve diagnosis and maybe guide treatment choices, this study will use machine learning techniques to categorize brain tumors according to their genetic markers.

approach: |
  The project follows a multi-phase pipeline:

  - Look for and collect transcriptome datasets (from NCBI GEO, for example)
  - Datasets should be cleaned, transformed, and ready for analysis
  - Analyze data exploratorily (EDA)
  - Use machine learning models like Ridge, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM, KNN, and LASSO.  
  - Utilize ROC curves and AUC values to assess models.
  - To increase accuracy, apply feature selection and dimensionality reduction.


  Open-source tools such as Python, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook will be used.

outcome: >
  The research will result in a trained machine learning model for brain tumor type prediction 
  at the end of the program, along with a poster presentation that highlights the model 
  architecture, training pipeline, and evaluation metrics. These outcomes will demonstrate 
  how AI can support medical diagnostics and genomic analysis.
