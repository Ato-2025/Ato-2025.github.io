what_i_learned: |
  We spent today honing and improving our Overleaf study paper.  Based on previous recommendations, we tightened our methodology section, clarified the results, and fixed formatting errors, among other significant changes.  After watching our recorded elevator pitch, our mentor provided us with helpful criticism regarding its delivery, tone, and intelligibility.  In order to make our key findings more powerful, he also assisted us in reconsidering how we presented them.  Our faculty mentor came by later in the day and gave our paper a thorough review.  He offered insightful advice on how to strengthen sentences, highlight important ideas, and keep the paper's scholarly flow.
  
blockers: |
  No major blockers, although balancing detailed paper edits with final pitch adjustments was slightly challenging.

reflection: |
  It was really beneficial to have our academic mentors and research mentors evaluate our work today.  Their comments helped us improve the final draft of our article by pointing out points we could have missed.  We were reminded of the importance of teamwork and mentoring as we worked together to edit and improve our project's written and graphic components.  We get more prepared and self-assured in our scientific writing and presentation performance with every session.
