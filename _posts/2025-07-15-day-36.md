# what_i_learned:
We went to the Business Building today, where we met a new teacher who led us in an engaging lesson on Myers-Briggs and VARK personality types. We discovered that being aware of our personality types and preferred methods of learning might enhance teamwork and research productivity. We were able to consider how we learn and perform best both individually and in groups thanks to the exercise.Our research mentor invited each of us to give a presentation on the status of our projects after our break. We got helpful criticism one by one that pointed us our strengths and areas for development. This was a great chance to consider how we have coded, handled, and interpreted the data thus far. 

# blockers:
No blockers.

# reflection:
I thought today's sessions were quite beneficial.  Acquiring knowledge about VARK and Myers-Briggs helped me better understand how I learn as well as how to interact and work with others.  The feedback session also made me realize how crucial it is to assess progress on a regular basis and make the required corrections.  It's important to improve the work rather than merely completing it.
