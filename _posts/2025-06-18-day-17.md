  We all gathered in the Business Building to begin the day, and Dr. Naja Mack provided us with a useful rundown of the format for our daily blog and video submissions.  She discussed the appropriate length and topic, which helped me better understand what is required of me on a daily basis.  We then played a fun game in which we had to use only words from the title to describe our study topic in 30 seconds.  Although shockingly difficult, it was a lot of fun.  The morning session was made more lively and engaging by the subsequent team-led game. 

  Teachers from high schools paid us a special visit later.  After introducing ourselves outside, we had a Q&A session during which Mr Richard inquired about our research, our findings, and our initial experiences.  It was pleasant to share our knowledge and think back on our journey.  The high school instructor had never taken a Python quiz before, so our mentor led one after the break.  It was entertaining and interactive.  We also took the time to guide them through our research introduction and show them our projects.  Presenting and outlining what we have been accumulating over the past three days felt terrific.

  None today – everything went smoothly.

reflection: |
  Today was full of learning, connection, and fun. I appreciated Dr. Mack’s guidance on how to structure our posts better and found the presentation games both helpful and entertaining. Meeting the high school teachers reminded me how far we've come and gave me a chance to practice my communication skills. Sharing our work and doing the Python quiz with them added a new layer of confidence to my learning. Days like this make research feel more engaging and collaborative.
