what_i_learned: |
  Today marked the first day of the research program. We were introduced to the basics of GitHub, including how it works, common commands, and how to manage code using version control. It was a great start to understanding how developers collaborate and track changes in projects..

  I also started exploring how to create a GitHub profile. It helped me understand how developers share their work and ideas with the world, and I’m excited to try building my own blog page soon.

reflection: |
  It was exciting to finally start the research program and learn something new. Getting introduced to GitHub and using some basic commands helped me understand how developers keep track of their work. I’ve heard about GitHub before, but actually using it made things clearer. I’m looking forward to learning more and using these tools in real projects.
