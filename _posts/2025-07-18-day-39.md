what_i_learned: |
  Our entire time today was spent polishing the Overleaf study paper's introduction.  To ensure that each subtopic has solid references and understandable explanations, our staff reread a number of articles.  Although we had to read a lot, it improved the basis of our paper.  In order to improve the organization and rethink some of the introduction, we applied the lessons we had gained from earlier feedback.  Today, we also filmed our weekly presentation video.  It served as a useful tool for reviewing our accomplishments and outlining our current activities. Giving a public presentation of our work made us more aware of our progress and areas for improvement.  All in all, it was a focused and successful day.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  I believe that we made significant progress today by concentrating just on the introduction.  It was exhausting to read so many papers again, but it was worthwhile because our introduction now sounds more thorough and is backed up by research.  We were also able to practice summarizing our work and gain confidence in our abilities by recording the weekly presentation.  The paper is gradually beginning to take shape.
