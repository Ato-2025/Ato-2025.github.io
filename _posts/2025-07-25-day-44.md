what_i_learned: |
   We all assembled in the Business Building today for a unique session that included an Alabama State University guest.  They showed us a number of real-world projects that their pupils had created.  A brain-related drone project was among the most intriguing; it demonstrated a potent fusion of robotics, AI, and neuroscience by reacting to facial muscle movements.  Seeing how creative concepts can be realized through practical research was encouraging.  Our group used the remainder of the day to get ready for our final PowerPoint presentation the following week after the presentation.  We spoke about how to present our research story in an engaging manner, how to divide up speaking responsibilities, and how to organize our slides.

reflection: |
  We became more imaginative about the potential of AI and biomedical technology after witnessing practical uses such as the brain-controlled drone.  We were also inspired to consider how we communicate our own findings.  We were able to synchronize our ideas and get on the same page for next week by working together on the presentation afterwards.  We're all growing more assured of our technical knowledge and our capacity to communicate it well.
