what_i_learned: |
  Today we had a formal, in-person welcome session where everyone dressed professionally. The mentors and faculty reintroduced themselves, and we received an overview of the AI Research Institute and what to expect throughout the summer. We learned about the meaning and goals of AI research and took a group photo to mark the occasion. To make things fun and interactive, we played a team-building game where we used spaghetti sticks and marshmallows to build the tallest standing structure that could hold the marshmallow on top—it was a creative and exciting challenge.
  
  We went to our respective labs to get settled in and begin exploring our workspaces.After the lunch break our mentor, Dr Roshan Paudel then walked us through what we’re expected to learn during the program, including Python, machine learning basics, and using tools like Pandas for data analysis. He also shared background knowledge about RNA sequencing, brain tumors, and examples of how previous research projects were structured and presented. Toward the end, our faculty mentor gave us time to work independently, which allowed us to reflect and explore some of the topics on our own.

  None today. Just making sure to review some of the research concepts again at home.

reflection: |
  Today was a great mix of formal introduction and relaxed learning. It was exciting to hear about what’s coming, and I appreciated getting some solo work time to think about the research project. I'm looking forward to diving deeper into Python and machine learning.
