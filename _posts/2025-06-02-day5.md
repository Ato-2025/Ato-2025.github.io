  Today we had a formal, in-person welcome session where everyone dressed professionally. The day began with Dr. Kofi Nyarko, Director of the CEAMLS program, who introduced himself and gave an overview of the program. He talked about artificial intelligence (AI), its use in real-world sectors like healthcare and finance, and the growing importance of generative AI. We were also introduced to Ms. Gabriella Waters, Director of the CoNA Lab, who shared her background in neurodiversity, AI ethics, and bias mitigation. A Q&A session followed, helping us better understand how AI connects to research and real-world challenges.

  Later, the mentors and faculty reintroduced themselves and gave an overview of what to expect from the AI Research Institute this summer. We learned about the goals of AI research, took a group photo, and participated in a fun team-building challenge using spaghetti sticks and marshmallows to build the tallest structure. It was a creative and engaging way to encourage teamwork and problem-solving.

  We went to our respective labs to get settled in and begin exploring our workspaces. After the lunch break, our mentor, Dr. Roshan Paudel, then walked us through what we’re expected to learn during the program, including Python, machine learning basics, and using tools like Pandas for data analysis. He also shared background knowledge about RNA sequencing, brain tumors, and examples of how previous research projects were structured and presented. Toward the end, our faculty mentor gave us time to work independently, which allowed us to reflect and explore some of the topics on our own.

  None today. Just making sure to review some of the research concepts again at home.

reflection: |
  Today was a great mix of formal introduction and relaxed learning. It was exciting to hear about what’s coming, and I appreciated getting some solo work time to think about the research project. I'm looking forward to diving deeper into Python and machine learning.
