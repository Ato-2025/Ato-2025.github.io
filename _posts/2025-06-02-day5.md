what_i_learned: |
  Today we had a formal welcome session where everyone dressed up. Mentors and faculty were introduced again, and we received an overview of the AI Research Institute.

  We learned what AI research is and took a group photo to mark the occasion. We also had a fun activity that helped us connect more as a team.

  Our mentor asked us what we are supposed to be learning during the program and shared a list: Python, machine learning basics, Pandas, and how we will use these tools in research.

  He gave us some background knowledge on RNA sequencing, brain tumors, and what a final research project might look like. He also walked us through examples from previous projects.

  Our faculty mentor also allowed us some time to work independently and explore topics ourselves, which was a great opportunity to reflect and explore freely.

  None today. Just making sure to review some of the research concepts again at home.

reflection: |
  Today was a great mix of formal introduction and relaxed learning. It was exciting to hear about what’s coming, and I appreciated getting some solo work time to think about the research project. I'm looking forward to diving deeper into Python and machine learning.
