## What I Learned

We were introduced to Andrew Kelly, who gave us a basic understanding of computer vision—its types, how it works, and real-world examples.

We used Google’s Teachable Machine to upload and train images. We also explored YOLOv8, where we ran code to detect objects in both images and videos.

We practiced Python basics on Replit and ended with a team puzzle game.

## Blockers

No major blockers, just reviewing object detection code again later.

## Reflection

**Today was fun and full of learning! I enjoyed working with Teachable Machine and YOLOv8. Practicing Python on Replit made things clearer, and the puzzle game was a great way to end the day.**
