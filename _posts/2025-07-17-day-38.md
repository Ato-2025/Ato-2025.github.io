what_i_learned: |
  Dr. Anita Pandey gave us an interesting and enlightening presentation today when our entire team visited the Business Building.  She explained to us the components of a good scientific presentation, including the title, abstract, methodology, results, and conclusions that should be included on each slide.  Additionally, she provided us with an invaluable tutorial on how to properly prepare and organize a research paper on Overleaf.  It made it easier to understand how to keep the manuscript's tone academic and consistent throughout.

  We also had the opportunity to candidly talk about the difficulties we were having with our presentations and paper.  Everyone shared their ideas, and it was comforting to see that we weren't the only ones going through difficult times.  The criticism from Dr. Pandey was helpful and realistic.  After that, there was a lighthearted and humorous Kahoot session. We went back to our research lab later that day and concentrated on honing our project.  My group put a lot of effort into enhancing our paper's introduction by reworking our research framing and adding new insights.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  I truly valued how today's lessons, conversation, and enjoyment were all balanced.  We took specific actions to enhance our writing and presentation skills during Dr. Pandey's workshop.  The atmosphere felt really cooperative because we were able to openly address our challenges.  I felt more productive than before writing the introduction with my team because we now knew what we were aiming for.  I learned from the day that support, camaraderie, and a little enjoyment may help make research feel less daunting and more rewarding.
