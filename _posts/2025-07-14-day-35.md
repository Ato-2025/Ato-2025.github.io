  Our mentor went over the code we wrote earlier this morning and pointed out areas that required work, particularly with regard to how we were figuring out and interpreting model correctness.  Our process was greatly improved by this explanation.  After that, he gave us an overview of normalization and scaling and discussed their significance for machine learning.  The standard deviation and its significance in comprehending data distribution were also covered. Following that, we focused on normalizing our code to use CPM (Counts Per Million).  In order to accurately modify gene expression values for comparison and subsequent model training, this step was helpful.  All things considered, these preprocessing enhancements increased the consistency and significance of our findings.

  I learned today how important it is to preprocess data before moving on to modeling.  Understanding normalization and standard deviation made it clear how improper handling of raw data could cause the algorithm to make mistakes.  It also demonstrated how careful data preparation can produce accuracy findings that are better and more reliable.  I'm beginning to gain confidence in my ability to organize a streamlined and efficient machine learning approach.
