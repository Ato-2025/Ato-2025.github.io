what_i_learned: |
  All of the participants assembled in the auditorium this morning to discuss Overleaf.  Mr. Michael Adeleke and Dr. Naja Mack gave us advice on how to format our elevator pitches for the session on Thursday.  They highlighted the main findings of our research and stressed the importance of being succinct, precise, and confident.  Following that, we received a thorough tutorial on how to properly cite sources in Overleaf and structure the paper utilizing relevant parts such as the methodology and introduction.  Understanding the professional framework of academic writing was particularly aided by this course. After that, we worked together to add our articles to the Overleaf project, concentrating on creating the methodology and introductory parts.  In accordance with the previously mentioned criteria, we also started correctly citing our sources.

  No blockers today.

reflection: |
  The discussion today made it clearer how to better arrange and format our final research paper.  Additionally, it improved our comprehension of how to get ready for our elevator pitch.  We felt more assured about the impending presentations and submissions since we were able to consult sources and work together as a team on Overleaf.
