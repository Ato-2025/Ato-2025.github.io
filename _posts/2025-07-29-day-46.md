 what_i_learned:
  Today was all about refining our final presentation. Early in the morning, we presented our draft to our mentor and one of our high school teachers. They gave us valuable feedback on what areas needed improvement—ranging from the flow of the slides to how we were explaining our results. We carefully noted their suggestions and spent the next few hours reviewing and correcting the slides based on their advice. Once we made those changes, we did another run-through of the presentation, applying the feedback and practicing our delivery again. This helped us feel more confident and prepared for the final day.

 blockers:
  No major blockers, but applying all the feedback and making sure everything was polished took some focused time and effort.

reflection:
  Getting the chance to present our work in front of our mentor and high school teacher gave us a fresh perspective on how we could improve. Their feedback helped us see areas we had overlooked, especially in how we explained certain slides. Taking the time to revise and present again made a big difference—it felt more clear and polished the second time. This experience taught us how important it is to reflect, refine, and practice continuously to make a strong final impression.
