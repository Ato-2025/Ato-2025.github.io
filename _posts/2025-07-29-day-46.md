what_i_learned: |
 The goal of today was to polish our final presentation.  We showed our slides to one of our high school instructors and our mentor in the morning.  They provided us with insightful criticism regarding our content delivery, slide clarity, and structure.  We carefully considered their recommendations and took the time to edit and revise the presentations to increase their effect.  We felt more prepared and confident when we gave our presentation again after implementing those changes.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Our message was strengthened by receiving comments and being able to make quick revisions to the presentation. Making two presentations in one day demonstrated to us how much clarity and confidence can be increased with a few well-considered changes. I was reminded by this process of the need of constructive criticism in producing high-quality work. Realizing how much our preparation and collaboration had paid off was a wonderful moment.
