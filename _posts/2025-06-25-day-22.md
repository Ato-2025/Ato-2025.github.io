what_i_learned: |
  Our group's goal today was to make our presentation slides better for the impending midterm.  We spent the morning going over the comments and making adjustments to the slides' organization, content flow, and visual clarity.  After that, we sought to improve our literature study by include more pertinent publications to back up our findings.  Our mentor provided a brief summary of key statistical ideas in the afternoon, which improved our comprehension of how to manage the data for our project.  We also assisted one another with material organization and citation formatting. Additionally, I learnt how to make technical concepts easier to understand for a general audience. I gained greater experience with correctly arranging sources by working on citations.

blockers: |
  Some challenges with properly formatting citations and summarizing complex articles, but teamwork made it easier to manage.

reflection: |
  We made significant progress on the presentation and the literature study by working together as a team.  I felt more comfortable evaluating data for our project after the statistics session.I'm starting to understand how the facts, writing, and slides from the research all work together.  My confidence in working on research projects in the future is growing with each task.
