what_i_learned: |
  I spent today looking for additional brain tumor datasets from sites like GEO and Kaggle.  In particular, I searched for labeled and cleaned datasets that distinguish between benign and malignant tumor types.  To learn more about which datasets were utilized in earlier research and how they were prepped for machine learning, I read a number of articles.  Additionally, one of our colleagues shared her data cleansing procedure.  She described how she prepared the framework required to apply machine learning techniques, sorted the labels, eliminated empty rows and columns, and transposed the data to meet the model format.  This made it easier to understand the practical procedures needed to prepare raw data for research.
  
blockers: |
  Some datasets lacked clear labels or had inconsistent formats, which made them difficult to use directly. It also took time to identify datasets with enough samples and relevant metadata.

reflection: |
  I was able to focus on the type of information we truly require by going over research papers again.  I became aware of the significance of complete and well-documented datasets after searching through Kaggle and GEO.  Our teammate's presentation was quite beneficial; it helped us understand how to organize our own dataset and made the connection between theory and practice.  I felt productive today and gained confidence in my ability to manage the data-related responsibilities for this project.
