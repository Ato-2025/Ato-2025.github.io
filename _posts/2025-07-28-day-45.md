what_i_learned: |
  Today was fully dedicated to preparing for our final presentation. I collaborated closely with one of our fellow participants to revise and polish the slides for our research showcase. We focused on improving visual clarity, ensuring smooth transitions, and refining the way we presented key points so that our message would be compelling and clear.After finalizing the presentation, I turned my attention to our Overleaf research paper. I spent the remainder of the day carefully reviewing and editing the document, incorporating the specific feedback provided by our mentor. This included fixing sentence structure, improving scientific clarity, and making sure the formatting was aligned with academic standards.

reflection: |
  Working on both the presentation and the research paper in one day was intense but fulfilling. It felt rewarding to see our project coming together in its final form and to apply the guidance we received throughout the program. Preparing the presentation helped me think deeply about how to effectively communicate complex research in a clear and engaging way. It also reminded me of how far we've come—from brainstorming our research topic to building models and interpreting our results.
