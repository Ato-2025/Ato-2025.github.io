what_i_learned: |
  Today was fully dedicated to preparing for our final presentation. I collaborated closely with one of our fellow participants to revise and polish the slides for our research showcase. We focused on improving visual clarity, ensuring smooth transitions, and refining the way we presented key points so that our message would be compelling and clear. 
After editing the presentation, I turned my attention to our Overleaf research paper. I spent the remainder of the day carefully reviewing and editing the document, incorporating the specific feedback provided by our mentor. This included fixing sentence structure, improving scientific clarity, and making sure the formatting was aligned with academic standards.

reflection: |
  It was demanding but rewarding to complete the research paper and the presentation in a single day.  Seeing our project come to life in its finished form and putting the advice we had received during the program to use felt satisfying.  I gave careful thought to how to clearly and captivatingly convey difficult findings when preparing the presentation.  From coming up with our research topic to creating models and analyzing our findings, it also made me realize how far we've come.
