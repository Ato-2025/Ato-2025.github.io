what_i_learned: |
  All of the participants met in the Business Building to start the day, and Dr. Naja Mack gave us a rundown of what to expect from the midterm presentation on Friday. She answered a number of participant queries and concerns while guiding us through the presentation templates. Any misunderstandings regarding the impending obligations were resolved as a result. We went back to our own labs after the seminar and started organizing our PowerPoint presentation. With the support of our mentor and a visiting high school instructor, we successfully finished the first half of the slides. While there is certainly room for improvement in a few areas, overall development was strong. We participated in an enjoyable machine learning quiz with Group 12 in the afternoon.  Our mentor created the test, which was a useful recap of our prior knowledge.  After that, we returned to our topic and concentrated on the literature review, delving further into pertinent research articles to bolster our analysis.

  No major blockers, though we identified a few presentation slide sections that need revisions based on mentor feedback.

reflection: |
  The quiz was an excellent way to brush up on our machine learning expertise, and the morning session helped us understand what to expect on the midterm.  Completing the literature study made me realize how crucial it is to support our efforts with reliable research.  The team is coordinating effectively in advance of Friday's presentation, and we are making consistent progress.
