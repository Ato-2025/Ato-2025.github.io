what_i_learned: |
  Today, we concentrated on utilizing Python to implement the main component of our methodology.  We began developing the machine learning code for our project on brain classification.  Seeing how the model's structure relates to the article we previously studied was enlightening.

  Batch Correcttion in RNA-seq datasets was one of the main topics we looked at today.  We discovered how batch effects can skew the analysis and how to use the `pyComBat` approach to account for them.  In order to make the data more similar, our mentor described how to recognize and model batches and use correction procedures.

 No blockers.

reflection: |
 Applying batch correction and observing how it enhances model consistency felt satisfying.  Understanding what our models are doing in the background was made easier by visualizing the findings using confusion matrices and performance indicators.  Our comprehension of the project's biology and machine learning components was enhanced by this practical session.  We're coming closer to building a reliable pipeline every day.
