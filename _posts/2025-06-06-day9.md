what_i_learned: |
  We started the day by working through Python tasks that taught us about new ideas like `while` loops and list functions like `insert()`, `remove()`, and `sort()`? These improved our comprehension of data management and program flow control. An excellent method to put what we've been studying into practice was to address real-world situations using mapping techniques.

 We thereafter concentrated on our group video project. After working on at least two slides, each team member gave their contribution. Despite the fact that it was our first video, we succeeded because of effective teamwork and communication. Seeing how teamwork can make even the most difficult things seem doable was a fantastic experience.

  We worked on our Python courses on Kaggle in the afternoon. Although there were challenging sections, it was satisfying to persevere and comprehend the subject matter. Getting my certificate after finishing the Kaggle Python Beginner course made me particularly proud. I gained confidence and a better comprehension of practical Python applications as a result.

  There were some difficulties finishing the Kaggle activities, particularly with list operations and mappings, but I overcame them with perseverance and encouragement from my peers.

reflection: |
  It was a rewarding and tough day. New ideas like while loops and list techniques were reinforced by starting with Python issues. It was my first time working on the team video, and although I was initially anxious, our collaboration made it a success.

  It was a proud moment to finish the Kaggle course and receive the certificate. It demonstrated to me how much I've learnt so quickly. All in all, I had a successful day that increased my confidence in both teamwork and coding.
