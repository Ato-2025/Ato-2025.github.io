what_i_learned: |
  The day started with us working through Python challenges that taught us about new ideas like `while` loops and list functions like `insert()`, `remove()`, and `sort()`. Through these activities, we improved our understanding of data structures and how to better manage a program's flow. We also looked at innovative approaches to problem-solving with maps, which was entertaining and instructive.

 We subsequently concentrated on our group video project. We each worked on a minimum of two slides and recorded our contributions. Despite my initial nervousness—especially because this was my first time creating a video of this nature—everything went smoothly because of our teamwork. Everyone helped each other out, and it was wonderful to be a part of something creative and cooperative.

  We turned our focus to completing the Python lessons on Kaggle in the afternoon. The lessons were difficult, particularly the sections on loops and list operations, but we persisted. Getting the certificate after finishing the Kaggle Python Beginner course felt great. The procedure offered us a sense of success in addition to reaffirming what we had been learning.

  Some challenges came up during the Kaggle exercises, especially around understanding list operations and how mappings work in loops. But I was able to work through them with practice and support from peers.

reflection: |
  Coding, creativity, and development were all mixed together today. I was able to strengthen my grasp of loops and list management thanks to the Python problems. Despite my initial reluctance, I also felt more confident after participating in the team video. I learned from recording my portion that growth requires venturing outside of your comfort zone.One of the highlights was finishing the Kaggle course. It inspired me to continue learning more and demonstrated my progress since the beginning of this program. Receiving the certificate made me feel proud and gave me a sense that the work was well worth it. Overall, the day was full of learning and teamwork. I felt more connected to my team and more confident in my coding skills. It was one of those days where everything felt meaningful.
