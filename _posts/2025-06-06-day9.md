what_i_learned: |
  We began the day by solving Python problems that introduced us to new concepts like `while` loops and list methods such as `insert()`, `remove()`, and `sort()`. These exercises helped us understand how to work with data structures and control the flow of a program more efficiently. We also explored how to use mappings in creative ways to solve problems, which was both fun and educational.

  Later, we focused on our group video project. Each of us worked on at least two slides and recorded our part. Although I was nervous at first, especially since this was my first time making a video like this, our teamwork made everything go smoothly. Everyone supported one another, and it felt great to be part of something collaborative and creative.

  In the afternoon, we shifted our attention to finishing the Python lessons on Kaggle. The lessons were challenging, especially the parts involving list operations and loops, but we stayed determined. It felt really good to complete the Kaggle Python Beginner course and receive the certificate. The process not only reinforced what we’ve been learning but also gave us a sense of accomplishment.

  Some challenges came up during the Kaggle exercises, especially around understanding list operations and how mappings work in loops. But I was able to work through them with practice and support from peers.

reflection: |
  Today was a mix of coding, creativity, and growth. The Python problems helped me solidify my understanding of loops and list handling. I also gained more confidence by contributing to the team video, even though I was hesitant at first. Recording my part taught me that stepping outside your comfort zone is necessary for growth.

  Completing the Kaggle course was a major highlight. It showed me how far I’ve come since the start of this program and motivated me to keep learning more. I felt proud to earn the certificate, and it made the effort feel truly worthwhile.

  Overall, the day was full of learning and teamwork. I felt more connected to my team and more confident in my coding skills. It was one of those days where everything felt meaningful.
