what_i_learned: |
 I worked on writing and editing the introduction to our research paper for the majority of today. To enhance the substance of our introduction and obtain more background information, I studied a few scientific journals. Additionally, I learnt how to correctly use the IEEE citation system when referencing sources. I was able to comprehend what a solid, evidence-supported section looks like thanks to our mentor's thorough description of the format required for literature-reviewed publications. We also learnt how to install Zotero, a useful tool for managing citations, to Microsoft Word and use it for referencing.

  No blockers today.
  
reflection: |
  Today was yet another significant day in the development of our study report. By supporting it with appropriate sources and correctly citing them, I became more confident in my ability to write an effective introduction. The process of citing sources was much easier when I learned how to utilize Zotero, and I feel better prepared to manage literature reviews in assignments going forward. The more I do it, the better I understand the research process, from reading and evaluating materials to accurately writing and crediting them.
