what_i_learned: |
  We were introduced to our mentors and learned about their roles and projects. It was helpful to get a clearer idea of how the summer program will be structured and what we’ll be working on.

  We also had an interactive session covering basic Python programming, and general coding logic. It helped refresh core concepts and gave us a glimpse of how we’ll apply them in our research.

blockers: |
  I had a bit of an internet issue during the session, which made it hard to follow everything in real time.

reflection: |
  Meeting the mentors made the program feel more personal and exciting. The coding session boosted my confidence, and I’m looking forward to combining these skills in the upcoming research activities.
