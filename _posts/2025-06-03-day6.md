  Today, we got straight to work in our lab.Tijesunimi Adeyemi, our mentor, had returned from his tour and told us about his experiences. He described how we will be working on our research project plan over the course of the summer and gave us insights into how AI can be trained using data, mimic human thought processes, and assist in decision-making.We also went over how probability and logic function in AI, how to train AI to recognize patterns and make predictions, and basic equations.

  We discussed the fundamentals of machine learning and artificial intelligence, including input/output systems, deep learning, logistic and linear regression, and the value of data.
   After that, we continued with independent study. I reviewed foundational topics like how AI works with data, makes predictions, and uses algorithms like logistic regression to classify outcomes. I also explored more Python concepts that will help us build and analyze our models this summer.
  
   I studied fundamental ideas like tuples, dictionaries, global vs. local variables, and Python's strip and append methods in addition to learning how to clean and prepare data.

  No major blockers today, just reviewing some of the math and logic behind AI tools.

reflection: |
  We learned a lot today about the foundations of AI as well as our summer project. I loved learning more about how AI "thinks" and learns, and it was fascinating to see how Python and machine learning fit into actual issues.
