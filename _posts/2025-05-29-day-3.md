what_i_learned: |
 We were introduced to Andrew Kelly, who gave us a basic understanding of computer vision—its types, how it works, and real-world examples. He explained how AI can be trained to recognize and understand images.

  We used Google’s Teachable Machine to upload and train images, and saw how it classifies photos. We also explored YOLOv8, where we ran code to detect objects in both images and videos.

  Along with that, we practiced Python basics using Replit, which helped us get more comfortable with coding. Also, we played a fun puzzle game as a team-building activity.

  No big blockers today. Some of the object detection code was a bit advanced, so I plan to review it again later.

reflection: |
  Today was fun and full of learning! I enjoyed working with Teachable Machine and YOLOv8. Practicing Python on Replit made things clearer, and the puzzle game was a great way to end the day.
