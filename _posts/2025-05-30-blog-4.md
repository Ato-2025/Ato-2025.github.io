what_i_learned: |
 We started off with a short survey and then moved into the “Python 101 Breakdown” Zoom room. We studied logical operators, Boolean values, and their applications in coding there. Using Replit, we also practiced developing and executing basic Python code.

  Later, we had a fascinating discussion on large language models (LLMs) and generative artificial intelligence. We looked at the distinctions between generative intelligence (GI), deep learning (DL), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI). With the aid of examples, we also studied the operation of LLMs utilizing ideas like tokenization and embeddings.

We played a fun Kahoot quiz that tested our knowledge in a light-hearted way.

blockers: |
 
  No big blockers today. Some of the object detection code was a bit advanced, so I plan to review it again later.

reflection: |
  It was a great learning day packed with useful information. I especially liked the breakdown of AI concepts and practicing logic with Python. The Kahoot session brought energy and made the learning more interactive.
