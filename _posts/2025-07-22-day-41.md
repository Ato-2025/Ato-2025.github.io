what_i_learned: |
  We spent the entire day using Overleaf to work on our research paper.  We concentrated on making the introduction, methodology, and preliminary findings of the paper stronger.  Our mentor provided thoughtful and detailed feedback, helping us identify areas that needed more clarity, precision, and scientific depth.  We learned how to improve the academic tone of our writing, structure our paragraphs more logically, and ensure consistency in our citations and formatting throughout the document.  Their guidance also pushed us to critically examine how we presented our machine learning methods and findings.

blockers: |
  No major blockers, though some of the feedback required significant rewriting which took more time than expected.

reflection: |
  The day of cooperation and editing was fruitful.  We improved the paper and gained a better understanding of how to fulfill academic standards by working in real time with our mentor's input.  We are more assured that our finished work will be understandable, expertly written, and factually sound.  We also gained a greater understanding of the value of organization, coherence, and collaboration in research writing as a result of the process.
