what_i_learned: |
  Together with everyone else, we began the day with a tour around the college. We walked around campus, visiting buildings from Business and Humanities to Engineering and Nursing. Despite the heat, we had a great time viewing the many departments and ongoing student projects, particularly in the Engineering building where students were engaged in practical work.
  
  We later went back to the lab to finish off our coding and problem-solving exercises. In addition to reviewing functions like `len()`, `input()`, and `str()`, we also practiced conditional logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else` expressions. Additionally, we looked at typical Python errors like name errors and indentation problems and learned how to diagnose them step-by-step. 

  We gained a greater understanding of the significance of declaring variables, formatting user input, and employing consistent indentation thanks to the exercises. In order to make the learning process more engaging and enjoyable, we also began incorporating tiny applications like a number guessing game and a car simulator.

  No major blockers today. My helped me debug small syntax errors and logic mistakes in my Python code.

reflection: |
  It was wonderful to explore the campus and work through coding challenges today. Observing the engineering students' work on campus was motivating.  Our comprehension of fundamental programming principles was strengthened by the practical Python tasks.  All in all, it was a successful and inspiring day.
