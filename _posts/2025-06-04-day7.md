  We began the day with individual learning after heading straight to our labs. Our goals for this week were to finish the Kaggle lessons by Friday and gain a deeper understanding of Python. The modules provided an introduction to machine learning, Python foundations, and core programming principles.

  To build conditional logic, we used Python control structures such as `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements. Along with that, we practiced using built-in methods like `strip()`, `append()`, and `input()`. We also explored key data types including strings, integers, tuples, and dictionaries, and began understanding how datasets are used to train and evaluate machine learning models.

  We engaged in lively discussions during breaks about the cultural differences in education systems between our home countries and the United States. We exchanged stories about teaching methods, student life, and the pressures placed on students in different environments. These conversations were both eye-opening and fun.

  No blockers today—just working through the Kaggle lessons at our own pace and helping each other along the way.

reflection: |
  The combination of coding and cultural exchange today was fruitful.I had fun picking up additional Python knowledge and applying it to real problems.I gained a better understanding of different education systems through our cultural sharing.All in all, it was a meaningful and enjoyable day.
