  We began the day with individual learning after heading straight to our labs today. Our goals for this week were to finish the Kaggle lessons we were given by Friday and to have a deeper understanding of Python. The modules provide an introduction to machine learning, Python foundations, and programming principles.

  To build conditional logic, we used Python control structures such as `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements. Along with practicing utilizing built-in methods like `strip()`, `append()`, and `input()`, we also learnt about key data types including strings, integers, tuples, and dictionaries. We also began to comprehend how datasets are used to train and assess machine learning models.

  We engaged in lively discussions during breaks regarding the cultural differences between the educational systems in our native countries and the United States. We exchanged tales about teaching strategies, school life, and the demands placed on kids in various settings. In addition to being instructive, listening to everyone's viewpoints and experiences was a lot of fun.

  No blockers today—just working through the Kaggle lessons at our own pace and helping each other along the way.

reflection: |
  The combination of coding and cultural exchange today was fruitful. I had fun picking up additional Python knowledge and applying it to actual issues.  I gained a better understanding of other educational systems from the cultural talks. All in all, the day of learning and sharing was enjoyable and significant.
