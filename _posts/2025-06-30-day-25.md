  Our faculty mentor, Dr. Roshan Poudel, shared a research paper with us on Friday.  The morning session was facilitated by TJ, our graduate mentor.  The many machine learning algorithms employed in the study Random Forest, KNN, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, QDA, Logistic Regression, and Gaussian Process were thoroughly examined as we read the paper.  QDA provided the best accuracy out of all of these.
  
  Additionally, we studied ideas like feature extraction, feature selection, and correlation matrix.  In order to measure model performance, the study introduced us to assessment metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC.  Following the conversation, we began coding and watched a useful YouTube video that provided a beginner-friendly overview of the subject: Python Machine Learning for Cancer Prediction

reflection: |
  We gained a better understanding of the practical applications of machine learning in research today.  It was simpler to comprehend the goal of each algorithm and how their performances are compared after reading the article together.  After the talk, coding helped me clarify things, particularly when experimenting with some of the methods that were discussed.  Our mentor's input also enabled us to stay on course and make any necessary corrections early.  Overall, the day was fruitful, and we're gradually gaining more assurance in our project's theory and coding components.
