what_i_learned: |
  Today, we focused on linear regression in Google Colab. To aid with the prediction of home prices, we created dummy variables and cleaned the data using pandas. In order to assess our knowledge of dataframes, if-else expressions, and loops, we also took a Python quiz. Following the break, we study further research publications, paying particular attention to the abstract, methodology, and RNA pictures pertaining to brain cancer. I discovered that AI can analyze these genetic pictures to aid in the diagnosis of illnesses. It was a useful day that made connections between biology, code, and actual healthcare.

blockers: |
  Dropping dummy variables and reading RNA visuals were a bit confusing.

reflection: |
  I now see the connection between genetic research and machine learning. I was able to determine what I understood and what I needed to refresh thanks to the Python quiz. Applying what we had learnt to actual data and seeing how it could be used to address medical issues was fascinating. I also learned how complicated yet potent AI tools can be from working with RNA diagrams. I feel more prepared and self-assured for our next assignment.
