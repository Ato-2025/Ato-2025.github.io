what_i_learned: |
  Today, we kept working on our research paper's beginning. I wrote a little by researching the details we required and including them in our draft. Initially, I encountered a few problems with Zotero, but I managed to resolve them. The format of the techniques section, the procedure, and the way the findings should be displayed were all covered by our mentor in our final presentation. This clarified for me what we need to get ready for in the future. Later, my friend and I worked together to discuss what needed to be improved or altered in the introduction.

  Some small issues with Zotero, but I was able to fix them.

reflection: |
  Making progress on the introduction and resolving the citation issues I was having was satisfying. I now have a better idea of what our final report should look like thanks to the presenting standards provided by our mentor. We were able to determine what to preserve and what to improve by working on the introduction with a teammate. I'm beginning to gain confidence in my ability to direct our research paper's writing and organization.
