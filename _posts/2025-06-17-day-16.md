what_i_learned: |
  Today we continued working on the introduction section of our research paper. I spent time writing and collecting important background information to support our topic. I ran into a couple of problems while using Zotero for citations, but I was able to fix them eventually. Our mentor also explained what the final presentation should look like and walked us through the process, including how to format the methods and results sections. After that, I discussed the introduction part with my friend who is also working on it, and we talked about what needed to be revised and improved. I learnt a lot today especially while i was reading the articles, I collected a lot of informations and data which will help me during the project. 

blockers: |
  Minor issues with Zotero citation tool, but they were resolved.

reflection: |
  Today helped me improve both my writing and understanding of how to structure a proper research introduction. Learning more about what should go into the methods and results sections was also helpful for preparing the final presentation. Working with a teammate made the writing process more efficient, and fixing the Zotero issue gave me more confidence in managing citations on my own. Each day, I feel like I'm becoming more comfortable with the tools and process of academic research. This research will definitely help me shape my skills and lot more for future use.
