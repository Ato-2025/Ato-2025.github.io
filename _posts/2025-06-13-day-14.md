what_i_learned: |
  We started the day by studying the process of cleaning data before it is evaluated in research papers, which helped me understand how important it is to use precise and trustworthy data in scientific research. We reviewed examples of data cleaning procedures, including how to handle errors or missing values in datasets. After that, we continued with a literature review by reading and discussing scientific articles related to our research topic, which gave me a deeper understanding of the background and current developments in the field. We also created a Zoom video in preparation for Friday’s session, where we summarized our activities from the week. This was a helpful way to reflect on what we’ve learned and see how much we’ve progressed. After recording, we returned to more reading and began writing the introduction for our group research paper.

  It was a bit difficult to figure out how to clearly connect ideas from different articles during the literature review.  
  Starting the introduction was also a little challenging, especially deciding how to frame our topic in a clear and engaging way.

reflection: |
  It was a productive and focused day. I was able to understand the backroom labor that goes into research after learning how to clean data. The week came together when we recorded the Zoom video, and I was pleased with our progress thus far. It felt more real to start the introduction because we are actually developing our paper piece by piece. I'm more comfortable adding to the writing and ensuring that our arguments are well-supported by evidence. Every stage, from writing to data cleaning, has given me the technical know-how and self-assurance I need to make a significant contribution to a group research effort.
