what_i_learned: |
  We started the day by studying the process of cleaning data before it is evaluated in research papers.  This made it clearer to me how crucial it is to use precise and trustworthy data when conducting scientific research.  We went over examples of data cleaning procedures, such as how to deal with errors or missing values in datasets.  Following that, we read and discussed other scientific articles pertaining to our research topic as part of a literature review.  I gained a greater comprehension of the background data and current advancements in the area as a result of this.  We also created a Zoom video in advance of Friday's session, in which we provided an overview of our week's activities. This was a good method to consider what we have learnt thus far and to look back on our development. After watching the video, we went back to reading additional books and eventually started writing our group research paper's introduction.

  It was a bit difficult to figure out how to clearly connect ideas from different articles during the literature review. Starting the introduction was also a little challenging, especially deciding how to frame our topic in a clear and engaging way.

reflection: |
  It was a productive and focused day.  I was able to understand the backroom labor that goes into research after learning how to clean data.  The week came together when we recorded the Zoom video, and I was pleased with our progress thus far.  It felt more real to start the introduction because we are actually developing our paper piece by piece.  I'm more comfortable adding to the writing and ensuring that our arguments are well-supported by evidence. Every stage, from writing to data cleaning, has given me the technical know-how and self-assurance I need to make a significant contribution to a group research effort.
