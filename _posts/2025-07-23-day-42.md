what_i_learned: |
  We worked on our research paper utilizing Overleaf all day long.  To make sure the introduction, methodology, and results parts were exact, understandable, and up to academic standards, we concentrated on improving them.  Dr. Roshan Poudel, our mentor, gave us insightful criticism that helped us organize our writing better and hone our scientific tone.  We also worked on making sure each section made sense and refining our citation style.  We focused on getting ready for tomorrow's elevator pitch after finishing the paper.  As a team, we wrote the script, making sure it was clear, educational, and interesting.  After that, we started rehearsing, honing our speech and making sure our timing adhered to the 60–90 second window.

blockers: |
  No major blockers, but balancing the writing and rehearsal took more time and energy than expected.

reflection: |
  It was a productive and demanding day.  Thanks to cooperation and real-time feedback, we were able to make great strides on our study paper.  We felt like we accomplished something after we finished the major pieces.  By switching to the elevator pitch, we were able to come up with innovative ways to explain our product to a larger audience.  We felt more confident in our writing and presentation skills as a result of the collaboration, edits, and practice sessions.  Tomorrow, we're excited to present our work.
