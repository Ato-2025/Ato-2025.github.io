 Our day started off with an exciting and unusual event: a driving simulation exercise organized by the engineering department.  We had the opportunity to test out a model they developed to investigate driving behavior, and each participant got a $15 Amazon gift card.  It demonstrated how models might be used in practical testing in an imaginative and captivating manner.When we got back to the lab, Dr. Roshan Poudel, our faculty mentor and graduate mentor, was there. Dr. Poudel assessed our current state of development and provided insightful criticism on areas that required development. We chose to start over after realizing there were some issues with the data we had previously gathered.We split up the task as a team; some of us concentrated on cleaning the data, while others sought for the pertinent sections. Because of this cooperation, the task was easier to handle and more effective. We also recorded our weekly video to cap off the day, which was enjoyable and allowed us to evaluate our development.

 We faced some issues with the initial dataset, which required us to recollect and reorganize the data.

  Today proved to be an indication that obstacles are a common occurrence over the course of research.  The driving simulation was an entertaining way to begin the day and demonstrated how real-world model testing is done.  Dr. Poudel's input kept us on course, and I felt like we were making progress as a team when we worked together to correct our statistics.  A productive day was well-capped off with the weekly video.    Additionally, I discovered that our research is strengthened when we are receptive to criticism.  I'm improving as a problem-solver thanks to these little revision sessions.
