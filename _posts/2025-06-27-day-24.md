what_i_learned: |
  I read and reviewed more in-depth research articles today in order to continue working on the introduction part.  Dr. Roshan Poudel, our faculty mentor, gave me suggestions that improved the writing's clarity and flow.  In Google Colab, we also worked on machine learning code for a while, which gave us a better understanding of how to put what we've been reading to use.  It was really beneficial to see how the code functions with real data.  Additionally, I learnt how to organize a DataFrame for analysis and how various variables interact within the dataset.  The theoretical ideas became much clearer after this practical exercise.We investigated how to clean and visualize the data and experimented with building and altering Pandas DataFrames.  Seeing how little code modifications impact the results and overall analysis was also beneficial.

  No major blockers.
  
reflection: |
  Applying our study concepts to code today was thrilling, and receiving candid input from Dr. Poudel helped us to clarify our objectives.  Having our high school instructor participate in the weekly video was another pleasure; it added energy and enjoyment to the conversation.  I'm beginning to get confidence in this project's technical aspects as well as its research substance.  Additionally, we started using GitHub to organize our work and development, which will keep everything collaborative and recorded.  It is turning out to be a useful ability to learn how to use GitHub for file management and version control.
