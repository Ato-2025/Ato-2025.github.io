what_i_learned: |
  I began using Overleaf today to write the introduction to our research report.  I had never before arranged our study in a formal academic manner, and I quickly realized how crucial structure is. Reham Kaifi's article [2] provided me with a thorough overview of AI developments in brain tumor classification.  Additionally, I worked on my ability to better incorporate citations into my writing and explain technical ideas. I also worked on simplifying technical concepts and got better at using references to back up my writing.

  No blockers today.

reflection: |
  I felt closer to the research and more certain about the direction of our endeavor after writing the introduction.  It made it easier for me to comprehend how prior research supports our objectives and how to express that in writing.  I'm learning how to write in an approachable yet educational style, which is crucial for a wider readership.  I'm becoming more confident in my academic writing and relishing the process with every draft.
