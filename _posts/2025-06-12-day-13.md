  We started the day with a bit of play and great games in the auditorium with all who were coming. The most exciting activity was Taboo, a word guessing game where we had to describe a word without uttering the obvious associated words. Our team played wonderfully well together and won the game. We also had Jenga, which was a thrilling challenge, although we lost that game.

  Later in the session, we saw Overleaf, the online LaTeX research paper writing platform. We all subscribed and accepted to enter our own personal details. Michael demonstrated how we would be using Overleaf throughout the summer to key in and set up the final research paper. It was good to experience that academic writing can be so well structured and polished using this tool.

  In the latter half of the day, we refocused our energies on research. We were taught how to look for useful data sources and also how to deduce the meaning of data put forth in scientific articles. We read through a few articles, carefully noting the figures, charts, and statistical terms used. Through this practice, I was much better able to pull useful information out of research papers.

  Figuring out how to read some of the datasets and understand complex article structures was a bit challenging. Some of the terminology was unfamiliar, and I had to reread certain parts to fully grasp their meaning.

reflection: |
  Today was a wonderful mix of teamwork and education. To start the games was an amazing way to connect and be a tighter team, which I believe will serve us well in the future when collaborating. Learning Overleaf left me feeling better prepared to be an asset to the final paper and be able to learn more about the writing process. Reading articles and manipulating actual research data put into perspective what it means to write a paper. I am becoming increasingly confident in both my research and teamwork abilities.
