  Final preparations and introspective contemplation took up the entire day today. To ensure everything was flawless and ready for the final display, we spent the day reviewing our presentation once more. We also had a team-wide discussion about the overall success of the research program—what we had learned, the challenges we faced, and the progress we made. In the afternoon, we gathered for a cultural potluck celebration. Everyone had the opportunity to share a bit of their heritage, as participants and groups brought in dishes that reflected their cultural backgrounds. It was a fun and tasty way to end the session, strengthening relationships and celebrating the diversity of our cohort.

reflection: |
  Today was a day of joy, reflection, and meaningful closure. Thinking back on our development, I realized just how impactful this experience has been for me—both academically and emotionally. The cultural potluck was a beautiful way to honor our diversity and connect on a personal level, beyond just research and presentations. It genuinely felt like a perfect ending to a journey filled with learning, laughter, and growth.Over the past several weeks, I've come to appreciate the power of perseverance, teamwork, and curiosity. Working with such a driven, talented, and supportive group reminded me that collaboration is at the heart of progress. Every person contributed something unique, and together we tackled challenges, celebrated successes, and built lasting bonds. The friendships and lessons I gained from this program will continue to shape me long after it ends.
