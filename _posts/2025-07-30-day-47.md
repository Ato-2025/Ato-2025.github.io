  Final preparations and introspective contemplation took up the entire day today.  To make sure everything was flawless and ready for the final display, we spent the day reviewing our presentation again.  We talked with our team about the overall success of the research program, including what we had learned, what we had faced, and how much we had developed. We got together for a potluck celebration in the afternoon.  Everyone had the opportunity to share a bit of their culture as a number of organizations brought in food that reflected their cultural backgrounds.  It was a fun and tasty way to end the session, strengthening relationships between participants.

reflection: |
  Today was a day of joy and concentration.  Thinking back on our development made me realize how beneficial this experience has been for me both emotionally and academically.  The cultural potluck was a lovely way to celebrate our cohort's diversity and establish deeper connections.  It genuinely seemed like a fitting conclusion to a voyage that will never be forgotten. Over the past few weeks, I've learned the value of perseverance, patience, and collaboration from working with such a driven and cooperative group.  Because everyone contributed something different, we were able to conquer obstacles as a team.
