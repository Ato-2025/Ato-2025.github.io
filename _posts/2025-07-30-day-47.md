  Today's entire day was devoted to last preparations and reflective reflection.  We spent the day going over our presentation again to make sure everything was perfect and prepared for the final display.  The overall success of the study program—what we had discovered, the difficulties we encountered, and the advancements we made—was also discussed by the entire team. We got together for a cultural potluck celebration in the afternoon.  Participants and groups brought in delicacies that represented their ethnic backgrounds, giving everyone a chance to share a little bit of their heritage.  It was a delightful and enjoyable way to wrap out the meeting, fostering camaraderie and honoring our cohort's variety.

reflection: |
  Today was a day of joy and concentration.  Thinking back on our development made me realize how beneficial this experience has been for me both emotionally and academically.  The cultural potluck was a lovely way to celebrate our cohort's diversity and establish deeper connections.  It genuinely seemed like a fitting conclusion to a voyage that will never be forgotten. Over the past few weeks, I've learned the value of perseverance, patience, and collaboration from working with such a driven and cooperative group.  Because everyone contributed something different, we were able to conquer obstacles as a team.
