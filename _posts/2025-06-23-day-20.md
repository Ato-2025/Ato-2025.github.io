what_i_learned: |
  We spent today working on improving our dataset and laying the groundwork for our next presentation.  I went over and gathered a few cleaned data files that better suited our study requirements during the morning.  I had the opportunity to investigate additional data-handling strategies, and I ultimately changed a number of sections of our dataset table to increase precision and readability. Following that, I turned my attention to our paper's introduction, revising and modifying some passages in light of what we had since learned.  I started working on our presentation slides with Samuel in the afternoon.  We chose to go cautiously, making careful plans to ensure that we conveyed our project clearly without hurrying through the material.
  
blockers: |
  No major blockers today, but starting the presentation took time as we wanted to organize our thoughts clearly and avoid rushing.

reflection: |
  I was reminded today of the significance of the little things in data preparation and writing.  I now have a better grasp of how clean data facilitates and strengthens analysis after reworking the dataset.  We're laying a solid framework for sharing our work, so working with Samuel on the slides felt like a positive step as well.  All in all, I was more assured of the course we were taking and eager to see what came next.
