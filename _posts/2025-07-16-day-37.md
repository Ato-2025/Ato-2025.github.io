what_i_learned: |
  We spent the entire day today going over the research paper we were working on on Overleaf in detail.  In front of our study mentor and one of our high school teachers, my friend and I presented our manuscript.  Walking through our research, from the history and methodology to the advancements in machine learning and biomarker detection, was an amazing experience. Following the presentation, our mentor gathered comments and ideas for how we may do better.  We talked about issues like clarity, flow, and which parts need more lucid illustrations or more robust scientific language.  Applying that feedback and collaborating to make the required modifications took up the remainder of the day.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  We were able to identify details on the screen that we had missed when we read aloud our study report.  We had a clear path for improvement because of the detailed and useful comments we got.  Sharing our work and practicing presenting it to others felt fantastic as well.  I discovered that gaining outside opinions truly helps us refine our work and that editing is just as vital as writing.  Our project felt more finished and authentic after taking this step.
