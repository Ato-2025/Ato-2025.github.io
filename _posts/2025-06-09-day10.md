  We started the day by going over the fundamentals of statistics. Important ideas like variables, input features, and dependent vs independent variables were discussed. We looked at a number of important formulas, including `y = mx + b`, which is the basis of linear regression and explains how machine learning models modify weights and bias to learn from data.

  Following the statistics introduction, we watched a YouTube video series to get started with machine learning. By providing the computer with labeled data so it can learn from examples, it assisted us in seeing and comprehending the process of supervised learning. Unsupervised learning, in which the computer learns without being given the right answer, was another topic we covered.

  We worked through actual machine learning tasks, such as estimating a person's income based on experience, test results, and interview performance, and estimating housing pricing based on factors like size, age, and number of rooms. These activities demonstrated how machine learning generates predictions based on patterns. The fact that we could make these types of forecasts on our own using Python and basic libraries was thrilling.

  Understanding how to clean data—such as dealing with text-based or missing items, like "five" in the experience column—and turn them into numbers before training the model was one of the challenges. However, we were able to clean things up by using the `word2number` library and `fillna()` with the assistance of the video and team support.

reflection: |
  It seemed like a significant step toward real-world AI today. Applying Python to real data and receiving predictions from our models was exciting and inspiring. The activities predicting salaries and home prices demonstrated to me that machine learning is more than just a theory; it's something I can accomplish right now. I also discovered that machine learning is a process that requires a lot of experience, reasoning, and math.

  My confidence was boosted by watching videos, solving actual problems, and practicing in groups. In the days ahead, I can't wait to continue investigating additional models and datasets. I feel like I'm becoming into a true data scientist after today.
