what_i_learned: |
  Today, we started by learning the fundamentals of statistics. Important concepts like variables, input features, and dependent vs. independent variables were introduced. We also looked at the formula `y = mx + b`, which is the base of linear regression and helps explain how machine learning models adjust weights and bias to learn from data.

  After the statistics part, we learned machine learning through a YouTube tutorial. It showed us how supervised learning works by training a computer with labeled data—data that already has answers. We also briefly discussed unsupervised learning, where the computer learns patterns without having labels or answers.

  The exercises were the most exciting part. We worked on real problems like predicting house prices using area, number of bedrooms, and age. Another task was to predict someone's salary based on experience, test scores, and interview performance. These hands-on examples helped us understand how Python and machine learning models can be used to predict real-world results.

  A challenge we faced was how to clean the data. For example, some experience values were written as words like "five", and we had to convert them to numbers using the `word2number` library. We also had to handle missing values using `.fillna()`. It took some effort, but we got it to work with the help of the tutorial and teamwork.

reflection: |
  Today felt like a major step into real-world AI. I learned that machine learning is not just theory; it’s something I can now practice using real data and Python. Predicting salaries and home prices gave me confidence and made the learning feel useful and exciting.

  Watching videos, solving challenges, and working together as a team helped me feel more capable. I’m excited to explore more datasets and models in the coming days and continue growing my skills as a future data scientist.
